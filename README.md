# Learning React
I'm learning React by building a game of Tic-Tac-Toe from the official React tutorial.

The tutorial can be accessed here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
